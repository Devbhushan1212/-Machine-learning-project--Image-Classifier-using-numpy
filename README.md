# -Machine-learning-project--Image-Classifier-using-numpy
In this project i have used python and Numpy to build a logistic regression classifier from scratch and apply the class of an input image-whether it is cat or not
Skills developed during this project :
1) Numpy
2) Python Programming
3) H5py files
4) Machine learning 

Note: Logistic Regression is a satistical technique of binary classification.
